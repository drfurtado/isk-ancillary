This tutorial is an adaptation of a chapter from *Learning statistics with jamovi: A tutorial for psychology students and other beginners* @daniellenvarro2019

The purpose in this tutorial is to introduce the concept of **correlation** and **linear regression**. These are the standard tools that statisticians rely on when analyzing the relationship between continuous predictors and continuous outcomes.
