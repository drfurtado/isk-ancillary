Below are several data sets I refer (and use) when performing the statistical analyses covered in the book.

# Human Benchmark

For the course at teach at CSUN, I ask students to complete a series of tests with the intent to measure the students abilities by asking them to complete brain games and cognitive tests, which can be found at the [Human Benchmark website](https://humanbenchmark.com/).

- [Reaction Time Test](https://humanbenchmark.com/tests/reactiontime)
- [Sequence Memory Test](https://humanbenchmark.com/tests/sequence)
