### Overview

Topics to be covered:

- Measures of central tendency
- Measures of variability
- Skewness and kurtosis
- Standard scores

---
### Measures of central tendency - Mean

- The **mean**<sup>1</sup> is the most popular index of central tendency
- The most sensitive of the central tendency indices
  - affected by every score in the
  - greatly affected by outliers
--

- Play important role on statistical inference
- Used with interval and ratio data<sup>2</sup>

.footnote[jamovi considers interval and ration as **continuous**]
---
#### Equation for the **sample** mean:
\begin{align} \bar{x}=\frac{\sum x}{n} \end{align}

#### Equation for the **population** mean:
\begin{align} \mu=\frac{\sum x}{N} \end{align}

.footnote[
[1] equal to arithmetic average
[2] In `jamovi`, interval and ratio = **continuous** data
]

---
### Measures of central tendency - Median

- Represents the score at the **50th percentile**
- Divides the data set in two
- Considered the “typical” score because it best represents the majority of other values
- Calculating the median does not take into consideration the value of other scores

--
- If *N* is odd, **median** is the middle score<sup>1</sup> 

---
### Measures of central tendency - Median

- If *N* is even, do one of the following:
  - Use the higher of the two middle scores
  - Compute the average of the two middle scores
  
--
- Use with ordinal data or cases of highly skewed distributions
- Important: not affected by extreme scores

.footnote[
[1] data must be ranked first.

What is the median for this set of data?

---
### Measures of central tendency - Mode

- Score that occurs most frequently
- No formula to calculate the mode
- A distribution may have more than one mode (bimodal or multimodal)

--
- Advantages
 - Easy to determine
 - Quick estimate of center
 - With normal distributions provides a fair description of central tendency (all three measures are similar)

--
- Disadvantages
 - Terminal statistic: lack of info that can be used for further calculations
 - Completely disregards extremes

---
### Guidelines for which to use

**Mode**: data are approximately normal & you only need a rough estimate

**Median**: ordinal data, middle score is needed, most typical score is needed, data is badly skewed by extreme scores

**Mean**: data are approximately normal, interval or ratio data, all available information needs to be considered, further calculations are to be made

---
### Measures of central tendency - `Practice`

It's time to apply what you have learned and calculate/get the `mean`, `median`, and `mode` for the following data set:

```
8, 31, 32, 56, 56
```

To do so, open `jamovi` online via [https://cloud.jamovi.org](https://cloud.jamovi.org)

- Then, proceed to type in the scores provided above into column B. 
- Next, rename this column to **scores**
- Also rename column A to **ID** and type in values from 1-5
- Finally, delete column C

See an example in the next slide or [click here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/vypo6h5r9zm9qp9/2022-02-10_22-43-15%20%281%29.gif?dl=0) - feel free to zoom in and out

### Measure of central tendency - Summary

- Measures of central tendency: Broadly speaking, central tendency measures tell you where the data are. There’s three measures that are typically reported in the literature: the mean, median and mode.
- Measures of variability: In contrast, measures of variability tell you about how “spread out” the data are. The key measures are: range, standard deviation, and interquartile range.
- Measures of skewness and kurtosis: We also looked at assymetry in a variable’s distribution (skew) and pointness (kurtosis).
- Getting group summaries of variables in jamovi: Since this book focuses on doing data analysis in jamovi, we spent a bit of time talking about how descriptive statistics are computed for different subgroups.
- Standard scores: The z-score is a slightly unusual beast. It’s not quite a descriptive statistic, and not quite an inference. Make sure you understand that section. It’ll come up again later.

### Measures of variability - Overview

1. Why variability is valuable as a descriptive tool
2. How to compute the range, the standard deviation, and the variance
3. How the standard deviation and variance are alike- and how they are different

---
### Measures of variability - Importance & Symbols

- Variability: reflects how scores differ from one another
- Also called  spread or dispersion

| Measurement               | statistics    | parameter |
| :---  | :----: | :----:   |   :----:      |
| Proportion     | p             | P         |
| Data points               | x             | X     |
| Mean           | $\bar{x}$     | $\mu$|
| Standard deviation        | s           | $\sigma$|
| Variance                  | s<sup>2 | $\sigma$<sup>2   |
| Number of persons/objects | n             | N|
| Correlation coefficient   | *r*            | $\rho$|


---
### Measures of variability - What is it?

- A measure of the spread or dispersion of a set of data.
- Builds on some of the fundamental concepts of parametric statistics.
- When we know both central tendency and variability, we can compare sets of data.
- Four measures of variability:
 - Range
 - Interquartile Range
 - Variance
 - Standard Deviation

---
### Measures of variability - Range

- Range is the most general estimate of variability
- There are 2 types of range, although the most commonly used is the exclusive range
- General Formula for Range
 - Also known as the Exclusive Range
 - Range = H – L 

Note: H is the highest score, L is the lowest score

---
### Measures of variability - Interquartile range

- Often used to analyze ordinal, or ratio data interval data when highly skewed. 
- More interested in the middle scores than in the extremes scores
- The difference between the raw scores at the 75th and 25th percentile.
 - Not affected by highly divergent  scores at the extremes (useful for skewed data)
- Presents a typical picture, but it does not consider all information about the data.
 
**Calculation: IQR = Q<sub>3</sub> - Q<sub>1</sub>**

---
### Measures of variability - Variance

- Previous two methods consider only 2 points of data to determine variability
- How about the remaining of the data?
 - Distance of each raw score from the mean of the data (deviation)
- Variance is more useful than range and IQR
- Allows us to compare the overall variability of two data sets.

---
#### Equation for the population variance

\begin{align} \sigma^2=\frac{\sum(x-\mu)^2}{N} \end{align}

#### Equation for the sample variance

\begin{align} s^2=\frac{\sum(x-\bar{x})^2}{n-1} \end{align}

  <img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ocf06abiuybus1b/var-calc-variance.png?dl=1">
</center>
- Calculating the distance of a raw score from the mean indicates variability (deviation).
- The sum of deviations around the mean will always equal 0.
- Absolute values show variability but cause a loss of information.
- Squaring the deviations is a better method.
- Taking the average of the squared deviations from the mean = variance.

---
### Measures of variability - Standard Deviation

- Calculating variance alone creates a greater magnitude of variability than the raw data alone allows (squaring deviation scores)
- Bring values for the variance **in line with the unit values of the original raw data**
- Standard Deviation = the square root of the variance
 - Estimate of the population standard deviation
- This allows for a score that is **standardized** with the value of the original raw data.

---
### Measures of variability - Standard Deviation

- Most frequently used measure of variability
- SD = s= average amount of variability in a set of scores
- What do these symbols represent?

**See equations in the next slide**

---
#### Equation for the population standard deviation

\begin{align} \sigma=\sqrt{\frac{\sum(x-\mu)^2}{N}} \end{align}

#### Equation for the sample standard deviation

\begin{align} s=\sqrt{\frac{\sum(x-\bar{x})^2}{n-1}} \end{align}

]

???
Sample and population equation

---
### Measures of variability - Why $n-1$ ?

- Samples rarely include the extreme scores.
- Samples almost alwayts have less variability - adjustment needed
- Standard deviation is an estimate of the POPULATION standard deviation
- To make it  an “unbiased estimate” you must subtract 1 from n
 - This artificially inflates the SD (it makes it bigger, unbiased) because it makes the denominator smaller

.bg-washed-grey.b--dark-black.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph2.mt2[Biased estimates are appropriate if your intent is only to describe the characteristics of the sample. But if you intend to use the sample as an estimate of a population parameter, then it’s best to calculate the unbiased estimate.
]

---
### Measures of variability - CoV

- What if one needs to compare standard deviations of two data sets that are in different measurement units?

--
Solution: normalize the standard deviations
___

Equation:

$V=\frac{s}{\bar{x}}\cdot 100\%$

Example in the next slide

---
#### Example

If students completed the push-up and sit-up tests and you want to verify in which test has less variability (is more homogeneous). Below are the results:

.pull-left[
Push-up test 
- $\bar{x}$ = 25 
- s = 5

5/25 = 0.2 * 100 = 2% 

$V=\frac{s}{\bar{x}}\cdot 100\%$
]

.pull-right[
Sit-up test 
- $\bar{x}$ = 30 
- s = 10

10/30 = 0.333 * 100 = 3.33%

$V=\frac{s}{\bar{x}}\cdot 100\%$
]

So, which of the two tests is more homogeneous (or consistent)?

???
Sit-up test, since CoV is less (2%)

---
### Measures of variability - final notes

- Standard deviation is computed as the average distance from the mean
- The larger the standard deviation the more spread out the values are
- Like the mean, the standard deviation is sensitive to extreme scores
- If s = 0, then there is no variability among scores and the scores are essentially identical in value
- While the formulas are quite similar…the two are also quite different.

Interpretation
- Standard deviation is stated in original units
- Variance is stated in units that are squared
 - Which do you think is easier to interpret???

---
### Standard scores

- The normal curve plots the score on the X-axis and an index of how common or frequent a score is on the Y-axis
- The standard deviation tells something particularly useful in the context of the normal curve
 - Standardizing scores helps us make sense of scores in relation to others
 - An example of this is Z scores

---
### Z-scores

.pull-left[
- Z score—a raw score expressed in standard deviation units
 - 1 SD = 11 kg
 - Mean of data set is 79 kg
 - 91 kg = Z score of +1 since it is 1 standard deviation above the mean
 - 68 kg = Z score of −1

]

---
#### Calculation

Equation:

$z_i = \frac{X_i - \bar{X}}{\hat\sigma}$

Z-score associated with a raw score of 91

**Z = 91-79 / 11 = + 1**

Z-score associated with a raw score of 68

**Z = 68-79 / 11 = -1**

---
### Z scores and stardard scores

.pull-left[
- Z score of 0 is equal to the mean of the distribution
- Z score of 1 is equal to one standard deviation
- The sign of Z score indicates the direction from the mean where − is below the mean and + is above the mean
]
.pull-right[
- Which of the following is a better score in comparison to the population?
 - Z = −1.3 on long jump or
 - Z = −0.50 on gymnastics scores?

### Skewness & Kurtosis
.pull-left[
<center>
  <img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/x5btzsogiln6qxe/skew-kurt.png?dl=1">

Skewness: is a measure of asymmetry of a distribution curve

$\mbox{skewness}(X) = \frac{1}{N \hat{\sigma}^3} \sum_{i=1}^N (X_i - \bar{X})^3$

]

.pull-right[
- Positive SD: more extremely large values than extremely small ones (right panel)
- Negatively SD: data tend to have a lot of extreme small values (i.e., the lower tail is “longer” than the upper tail) and not so many extremely large values (left panel)
]

### Skewness & Kurtosis
.pull-left[
<center>
  <img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/duq651uoszno7ok/kurtosis-imag.png?dl=1">
</center>

Kurtosis: is a measure of the “pointiness” of a data set

$\mbox{kurtosis}(X) = \frac{1}{N \hat\sigma^4} \sum_{i=1}^N \left( X_i - \bar{X} \right)^4  - 3$
]

.pull-right[

| informal term |	technical name | kurtosis value |

|“too flat”|platykurtic|negative|
|“just pointy enough”|mesokurtic|	zero|
|“too pointy”|leptokurtic|positive|
]

### Skewness & Kurtosis - Z-scores

.pull-left[
- Z scores used to quantify the amount of skewness and kurtosis in a set of data
- We convert raw skewness and kurtosis scores to Z scores!
- Take the raw skewness and kurtosis scores and divide them by their respective standard errors (a type of standard deviation)
- The numbers **6** in the SE<sub>skew</sub> equation and **24** in the SE<sub>kurt</sub> equation, are constants
]
.pull-right[

</center>
Z<sub>skew</sub> = Skewness / SE<sub>skewness</sub>

Z<sub>kurt</sub> = Kurtosis / SE<sub>kurtosis</sub>
]

---
### Skewness & Kurtosis - interpretation

If values of **Z<sub>skew</sub>** fall within +- 2.0 z-cores, then the distribution is approximating normality as far as SKEWNESS is concerned.

If values of **Z<sub>kurt</sub>** fall within +- 2.0 z-scores, then the distribution of scores is approximating normality as far as KURTOSIS is concerned.

Else, the distribution of scores would be deviating from normality as far as...

#### Example

  <img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/hvkgt0x34dtph1o/exemple-calc-zkurt_zskew.png?dl=1">
</center>

What is the conclusion here?

???

For both skewness and kurtosis, the distribution of scores are approximating normality since the zskew and zkurt fall within +- 2.0 z-scores

### More jamovi practice

While in class, we will use jamovi to calculate:

- measures of central tendency
- variability
- skewness and kurtosis
